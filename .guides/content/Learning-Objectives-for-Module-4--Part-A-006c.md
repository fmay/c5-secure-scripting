**Lab	files	that	are	needed**
These	are	all	in	the	directory	`data`,	which	can	be	copied	to	the	students’	systems	or	put	out	for	them	
to	download.

- `dict.txt` - this	file contains	a	list of words, one	per	line.	It is used throughout this part.
- `mycat.sh` - this	is	the	program	referenced	in	slides	23–26.	It	is	provided	so	the	students	can	try	the	different	
quotes
- `x`,	`y`,	`x	y` - theseare	the	three	files	used	in	slides	23–26	to	demonstrate	proper	use	of	quotes.
