The Bourne Shell is the oldest current **\*nix** shell.

"\*nix" means any version of Unix, including Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD etc.


It was originally written by Steve Bourne. Later version (“Bourne-again Shell”, bash) added functions, operators and more.

It is now commonly referred to as **bash** scripting. 

This language allows one to combine programs already written to perform a task or set of tasks. It also provides a framework for testing conditions and performing I/O both through the command line and using files
.
A later version of this shell, called the Bourne-again shell (or bash) provides a superset of this language, including adding functions. We will not use these, because on systems without bash, the functions may not work.

Although this language is particular to the Bourne shell, the ideas and many of the constructs also apply to other \*nix command interpreters such as the C shell (csh and tcsh), the Korn shell, and so forth.
