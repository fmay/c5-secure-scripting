On the left is a *terminal* window. This gives you access to the *command line* where you can enter commands that run programs, utilities and scripts that you write yourself.

## Listing files
Let's play with the command line by typing the following

```
ls -al
```

This command lists all the files in the current directory. As it happens, you can also see the files in the file tree on the left hand side.

## Changing directory
If you look at the file tree, you can see there is a directory (also know as a folder) called `poem`. Click on it to open it up and see the files inside it.

From the command line, you can change directory as well.

```
cd poem
```

Now list the files in this folder with `ls -al` again.

## Displaying files
You can view the contents of a file by opening it from the file tree. Open up `verse1.txt`.

You can display the contents of a file from the command line as well. 

```
cat verse1.txt
```
