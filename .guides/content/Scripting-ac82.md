Using a language written for a tool to automate
actions

- Faster than writing a program in a programming language like C
- Interpreted, not compiled (although some scripting languages allow scripts to be compiled)
- Scripting languages typically more high-level


Scripting is useful when when one needs to complete a task quickly, or when the task can be completed by combining multiple existing programs.

**A caution**: scripts are often much less efficient than compiled programs 

- in part because scripts are usually interpreted (this adds the overhead of the interpreter) 
- and in part because they invoke other programs (adding the overhead of program invocation)

Scripting is often used for rapid prototyping, where the goal is to build a simple version of the desired program to test different approaches and to develop a mechanism for testing user interfaces. 

One can quickly implement different algorithms and try different data representations to find the one that is most suitable (due to performance, interaction with other components, user needs, and so forth).
